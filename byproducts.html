            <p>People are accustomed to seeing and using different kinds of instant coffee, but the development of instant teas has lagged far behind that of instant coffee market. In the case of instant tea, the liquor (tea brew) itself is further concentrated and dried to form a powder or granular product. Hot water soluble and cold water-soluble instant teas are found in the market. Process of the production of instant tea consists of the following operations, selection of raw materials, extraction, aroma stripping, cream processing, concentration and drying. Criteria for the selection of the raw material include processing requirements of the market for which the tea is intended, and the commercial restrictions placed upon manufacture. Instant tea can be made from black tea leaf, (partially) fermented, undried leaf, oolong or green tea. Manufacturers in tea producing countries use fermented undried leaf as a basis for instant black tea production, as this does not have to pass through the auctions and is therefore cheaper. As per the final user of the instant tea the demand for the type of instant tea varies as hot water soluble, cold water soluble and green instant tea.</p>
